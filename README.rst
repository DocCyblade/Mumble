Mumble Server - MyMumb-Panel and phpMumbleAdmin Web Interfaces
=======================================================

Mumble is an open source, low-latency, high quality voice chat 
software primarily intended for use while gaming. Mumble is 
free software, meaning it is available at no cost and under a very 
liberal license. The client is called "Mumble". The Server is 
known as "Mumble Server" or "Murmur".

Mumble's server component, Murmur, allows anyone to run a server 
of their own for public or private use, free of charge. Murmur 
supports extensive user permission configuration using access 
control groups (ACLs) and can be configured programmatically via 
RPC. A single Murmur daemon can also run multiple Murmur servers 
on different TCP/UDP ports.
